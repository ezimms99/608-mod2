Chapter 3 Notes: 
Algorithms
- Procedure for solving a problem in terms of:
    - The actions to execute 
    - The order they are executed in
- Program control specifies the order in which the statements execute in a program. 

Pseudocode 
- Informal english-like language for "thinking out" algorithms
- Statements that specify the actions you want to take and the order you want to take them in. 

Control Statements 
- Typically statements execute sequentially but with a control statements you can execute a statement other than the next one in a sequence. 
3 forms of control
- Sequential Statements: Python statements execute one after the other unless directed otherwise. 
    - Flowcharts show sequential execution. Use a rectangle for actions and flowlines to show the order. In a flowchart for complete algorithm the first symbol is a rounded rectangle containing the word begin. The last is a rounded rectangle containing end. In part of an algorithm you use circles in their place called connector symbols. Decision symbols indicated that a decision is to be made such as an if statement. 
- Selection Statements: Python provides three types of statements that execute code on a condition that evaluates to true or false. 
    - If statement (single selection), if action is true it does the action if false it skips. 
    - If...else statement (double selection), performs action if true or performs different action if false. 
    - if...elif...else statement (multiple-selection), performs one of many actions depending on truth or falsity of conditions. 
- Repetiion Statements: Provides two repition statements: while and for:
    - While statement repeats an action as long as condition remains true
    - For repeats an action for every item in a sequence of items. 
    
If Statements:
- Indentation after if statement is important!! You must also have same indentation for multiple statements. 
- If statement flowcharts
    - The decision symbol is a diamond and if not executed the flowline skips the action and if true it moves to execute the action. 
- Remember!!! The = sign assigns a value to a name and the == sets that value as an equality operator. 

If...else and if...elif...else statements:
